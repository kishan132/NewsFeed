# NewsFeed

This is the News Feed Android application to check the news of multiple categories
This app is connected with Firebase for backend support. User authentication is done with Firebase
Users can swipe among multiple fragments to check the news of different categories

User Authentication is done with email and password.
I am also using Room Database to cache all responses such that users can also get news when the device is offline. This application is built on MVVM architecture.


You can connect your app with Firebase from here https://console.firebase.google.com/

I am using NewsAPI to fetch all news.

You can create your own profile and get API_KEY from here https://newsapi.org/
